      Who is Tarkan Mansuroğlu?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Tarkan Mansuroğlu is a front-end web developer. He started learning coding by himself and continued his coding education through “Re-Coded Front-End Web Development Bootcamp”. He became a coder because he is a lifelong learner and addicted to the sensation that comes after solving a tech problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      He discovered his appetite for challenges in his early 20s. At age 20, he was severely obese and academically lost. At 22 he dropped from 175kg to 95 kg, became a fitness enthusiast and top finance student of his university. Later, he graduated with highest CGPA and continued being a physically active person.
    </p>
    <p>
      During these years, he wanted to figure out what he expected from life. While searching for his purpose, he realized that to build his future, first, he needs to understand himself. This revelation pushed him to develop an analytical mindset. Consequently, he realized that problem solving is the main drive of things he enjoys. Thus, when he started coding, he fell in love with it.
