      Tarkan started learning coding by himself and continued his coding
      education through “Re:Coded-Flatiron School Front-End Web Development
      Bootcamp”. He became a coder because he is a lifelong learner and in love
      with practicality of programming.

      He discovered his appetite for challenges in his early 20s. At age 20, he
      was severely obese and academically lost. At 22 he dropped from 175kg to
      95kg, became a fitness enthusiast and top finance student of his
      university. Later, he graduated with highest CGPA and continued being a
      physically active person.
    </p>
    <p>
      During these years, he wanted to figure out what he expected from life.
      While searching for his purpose, he realized that to build his future,
      first, he needs to understand himself. This revelation pushed him to
      develop an analytical mindset. Consequently, he realized that problem
      solving is the main drive of the things he enjoys. Thus, when he started
      coding, he fell in love with it.
