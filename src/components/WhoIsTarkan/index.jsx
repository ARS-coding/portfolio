      </h2>
      <p>
        Tarkan Mansuroğlu is a front-end web developer. He started learning
        coding by himself and continued his coding education through “Re-Coded
        Front-End Web Development Bootcamp”. He became a coder because he is a
        lifelong learner and addicted to the sensation that comes after solving
        a tech problem.

        He discovered his appetite for challenges in his early 20s. At age 20,
        he was severely obese and academically lost. At 22 he dropped from 175kg
        to 95 kg, became a fitness enthusiast and top finance student of his
        university. Later, he graduated with highest CGPA and continued being a
        physically active person.

      <p>
        During these years, he wanted to figure out what he expected from life.
        While searching for his purpose, he realized that to build his future,
        first, he needs to understand himself. This revelation pushed him to
        develop an analytical mindset. Consequently, he realized that problem
        solving is the main drive of things he enjoys and consistent at. Thus,
        he decided to try coding and fell in love with it.
